### The Workflow to Create this Website:

1. **Find a bootstrap template for basic front-end, and modify the static web pages, as well as the css and js files. The website structure contains homepage, blog, photo album, and about page.**

2. **Create a new project and applications under it. Configure settings and run the project under localhost.**

	2.1 Create classes in models. The classes will be tables in database to store data from front-end users and back-end admin.

	2.2 In views, create functions to extract data from database and process them so they are in the correct form to be passed to each web page.

	2.3 Write django template language (DTL) in templates, so the data from views can be rendered on the pages.

	2.4 Set urls in both html files and urls.py files, so when users click each button on the page, the page directs or reverse directs to another with corresponding data displayed.

	2.5 Set admin configuration in admin.py files, so the tables in database can be manipulated from back-end admin page, for example, add, update or delete data (CRUD operations).

3. **Add some articles and photos from back-end to check the functionality and visual effects**

4. **Based on MVC framework, add components for each page.**

	4.1 create registration and log-in for index page

	4.2 create profile management, including email verification and avatar modification for profile page

	4.3 create comment section with rich text editor and user avatar for article pages

	4.4 create a message board for about page

	4.5 add Google reCAPTCHA verification for article comments and message board

5. **improve front-end effects during each step**

6. **test all functions under localhost**

7. **set logging in settings for web requests and responses**

8. **set debug=False, create error 400, 403, 404, 500 pages, and set email notification for errors**

9. **decouple private information from settings.py to .env file or to system environment variables**

10. **deployment to the cloud server**

11. **test all functions under production and fix errors**

12. **purchase a domain, set DNS directing to IP address of the cloud server**
